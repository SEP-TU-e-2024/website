          BenchLab is a platform where researchers can benchmark their optimization problem
          algorithms and solutions. BenchLab has been developed for ORTEC as part of a bachelor end
          project for Computer Science and Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
          <br />
          <br /> {/* Double break to separate paragraphs for improved readability */}
          The platform shows a range of specified problems to view or submit to. An account is not
          required to make submissions; it is also possible to only enter an email address for
          validation when making a submission. There are two types of specified problems: problem
          instances, consisting of a single benchmark instance, and problem occurrences, consisting
          of a set of problem instances. Users can evaluate their algorithms by making code
          submissions to problem occurrences, or make solution submissions to a specific problem
          instance if they think they found a new Best Known Solution for that instance. BenchLab
          provides an environment for these evaluations to be run by validators and display their
          results. A submission must adhere to the problem's evaluation settings, such as number of
          CPUs, runtime or memory limit.
          <br />
          <br />
          Submissions are ranked on leaderboards based on their score, which is computed during
          evaluation. Some submissions and their results can be downloaded for manual evaluation as
          well. That way, BenchLab facilitates easy and transparent benchmarking and comparison of
          algorithms and solutions.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is also possible to use the platform to host competitions, in which case certain data
          on its submissions' performance is hidden but the leaderboard is still shown. New
          specified problems can be added to the platform by admins, providing info on the problem,
          evaluation settings and the code to evaluate submissions for this specified problem.

          When the user uploads code to BenchLab, the system will spin up an isolated docker
          container. Thus, the submission will be run in a controlled environment. Using the
          custom-developed IOModule, both static and interactive validators can communicate with the
          code submission. For further information on the setup of a submission, check the example
          submission found on the submission tab of a specified problem. category page.
